# Personal-Project #1

Here I realized the **first** personal project, it represents a **digital book library**, the goal was to mix **HTML**, **CSS**, **PHP** and some **JavaScript** which was a **weak** point at this **training point**.

- [x] **PHP** arrays where the data of the books is stored and from it's **displayed**
- [x] **JavaScript** function which displays a **star rating system**
- [x] **JavaScript** function that allows you to turn pages **without changing pages** in your browser
- [x] **JavaScript** function that allows you to change the **size** of the text
- [ ] **DB.php file** which represents the **connection** to the **DB** is not there to **protect** my identifiers.
